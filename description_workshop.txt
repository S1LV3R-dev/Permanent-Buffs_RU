[h1]Permanent Buffs[/h1]

Permanent Buffs is a simple mod that allows the user better control over their buffs. Tired of having to go to each station everytime you respawn?
Tired of having to replace banners everywhere you go? Tired of your summons expiring in your afk farm? Permanent buffs has you covered.

- PermaBuff: By designating a buff as a 'PermaBuff', it becomes permanent. This means the buff has an infinite duration and will be re-applied instantly if it's ever deleted.
PermaBuffs are indicated by a Golden Border around the buff icon.
- NeverBuff: By designating a buff as a 'NeverBuff', it becomes inactive. This means the buff will be blocked from applying its effects in 'Buff.Update' and force enables deletion by right clicking the buff. 
Neverbuffs are indicated by a Purple Border around the buff icon.

Both Permabuffs and Neverbuffs can be toggled by hovering the mouse over the buff icon and pressing their respective keybinds.

This mod should be compatible with most other mod buff and does not change any behaviour unless the config options are enabled. Some additional features are:
- Option to selectively apply death/save&quit persistence to station buffs, so you don't have to click the stations every time you respawn.
- Option to selectively apply death/save&quit persistence to banners, so that they remain with you wherever you go once placed.
- Option to disable visuals on affected buff icons.
- Option to hide additional keybind tooltips once the keybinds are bound.
- Option to disable death/save&quit persistence entirely.
- PermaBuffing summons is now FULLY supported! As long as you keep the summoning item in your inventory and PermaBuff the icon, the mod will automatically fill all your summon slots! This works with mod summons too.
- Option to enable experimental cross-mod functionality patches.

**Disclaimer**: Depending on the buff in question, enabling/blocking/force deleting the buff using Perma/NeverBuff might not work fully. This is because certain buffs have their behaviour decided somewhere that isn't in Buff.Update
This is the case with Potion Sickness (patched as of 1.6.1) and certain other modbuffs. Please report these exceptions to me through github/discord, so I can patch them.

Possible future changes: 
- Patching buffs from any other reports I recieve for other mods.
- Any other suggestions/bugs as raised in Github or in the discord.
